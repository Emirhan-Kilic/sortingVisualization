# Sorting Visualization

Visualization of Sorting algorithms in Java
Planned to have:    
1-Bubble Sort    
2-Selection Sort    
3-Insertion Sort    


~~4-Merge Sort~~ 
~~5-Quick Sort~~   
Merge and Quick sort was hard to visualize and required further specialized methods to properly showcase their steps which I may add later

Visualization using Java Swing and bar graphs
